#Evaluating Factors Influencing PISA Test Reading Scores
**Problem Statement**:
The PISA (Program for International Student Assessment) dataset provides insight into the
educational performance of 15-year-olds worldwide. This project aims to analyze various
factors influencing students' reading scores. By evaluating demographics, parental
education, school characteristics, and student behavior, we will identify significant predictors
of reading performance. The findings can help educators and policymakers understand how
to improve student outcomes.
